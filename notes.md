# Notes

## 04.09.2022 -- *Basic installation*

Code for scanning i2c devices connected:

```python
import board
import busio as io

i2c = io.I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA)
while not i2c.try_lock():
    pass
print([hex(x) for x in i2c.scan()])
```

We see the following devices connected:

- `0x0b`: LC709203
- `0x41`: TMF8821
- `0x77`: BME280
- `0x3c`: Zio ILED

To initialize the OLED display and show the REPL output as well as our own prints, run:

```python
import board
import displayio
import adafruit_ssd1327

displayio.release_displays()

i2c = board.I2C()

display_bus = displayio.I2CDisplay(i2c, device_address=0x3C)
display = adafruit_ssd1327.SSD1327(display_bus, width=128, height=128)
```

To use the buzzer, we need to connect it to a pin which supports PWM.
From [here](https://github.com/Dlloydev/ESP32-ESP32S2-AnalogWrite) we get a list of supported pins:

| Board    | PWM Pins                          | PWM Frequency   | Resolution                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| ESP32    | 2, 4, 5, 12-19, 21-23, 27, 32, 33 | 1000 Hz default | 1-16 bit PWM, 8-bit default |
| ESP32-S2 | 1- 14, 21, 33-42, 45              | 1000 Hz default | 1-16 bit PWM, 8-bit default |
| ESP32-C3 | 0- 9, 18, 19                      | 1000 Hz default | 1-16 bit PWM, 8-bit default |

We decide for pin `A5` (GPIO8).

To control the e-ink display, run:

```python
import time
import busio
import board
import displayio
import adafruit_il0373

displayio.release_displays()

# This pinout works on a Feather M4 and may need to be altered for other boards.
spi = busio.SPI(board.SCK, board.MOSI)  # Uses SCK and MOSI
epd_cs = board.D9
epd_dc = board.D10

display_bus = displayio.FourWire(
    spi, command=epd_dc, chip_select=epd_cs, baudrate=1000000
)
time.sleep(1)

display = adafruit_il0373.IL0373(display_bus, width=296, height=128, rotation=270, black_bits_inverted=False,
                                 color_bits_inverted=False, grayscale=True, refresh_time=1)
g = displayio.Group()

with open("/sketch.bmp", "rb") as f:
    pic = displayio.OnDiskBitmap(f)
    t = displayio.TileGrid(pic, pixel_shader=pic.pixel_shader)
    g.append(t)
    display.show(g)
    display.refresh()
    print("refreshed")
    time.sleep(120)
```

## 16.09.2022 -- *Peripheral Tests*

AM2320 answers correctly, but the example is wrong: reading consecutively with no sleep time in between doesn't work.
Thus, wait > 100ms between reading (even temperature --> humidity):

```python
import time
import board
from busio import I2C
import adafruit_am2320

# create the I2C shared bus
i2c = I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA, frequency=125000)
am = adafruit_am2320.AM2320(i2c)

delay = 0.1

while True:
# Note: reading from the sensor within intervals of > 10Hz is not supported:
# It goes to sleep mode and doesn't wake up on time. Thus, wait at least 100ms
# before performing another reading. The sensor itself doesn't update the internal
# measurement register more frequently than every 2s anyway.
print("Temperature: ", am.temperature)
time.sleep(delay)
print("Humidity: ", am.relative_humidity)
time.sleep(delay)
```

## 02.10.2022 -- *BME280*

```python
"""
BME280
"""
import time
import board
import adafruit_bme280.advanced as adafruit_bme280

i2c = board.I2C()
bme280 = adafruit_bme280.Adafruit_BME280_I2C(i2c)

bme280.mode = adafruit_bme280.MODE_FORCE
bme280.iir_filter = adafruit_bme280.IIR_FILTER_DISABLE
bme280.overscan_temperature = adafruit_bme280.OVERSCAN_X16

while True:
    print(f'Temperature: {bme280.temperature:.2f}Â°')
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

We also found out we have the [revision C board](https://learn.adafruit.com/assets/109937),
since the open-state value of I2C_POWER is *low*

## 05.01.2023 -- *Bootup time*

We set the alarm time to `t_start + 15`
Time measured that the boot process takes until it gets to the `t_start = time.monotonic()`:
16.30, 16.27, 16.38, 16.21, 16.33
--> average: 16.298 ~ 16.3 ==> bootup time = 1.3s

## 06.01.2023 -- *AM2320 Connection Failures*

The AM2320 doesn't answer to I2C calls from a cold start of the uC. Soft restart makes it work flawlessly. Related
problems online:

- https://community.home-assistant.io/t/temperature-humidity-sensor-with-am2320-esp32/360126/10
- https://github.com/esphome/issues/issues/1742
- https://github.com/esphome/issues/issues/192#issuecomment-481171704

The following code works both in soft restarts and cold starts:

```python
import time
import board
from busio import I2C
import adafruit_am2320
import digitalio

led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.LED)
led.switch_to_output(True)

# Block 1: restart i2c bus
i2c_pow = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.I2C_POWER)
i2c_pow.switch_to_input()
time.sleep(0.5)
default_state = i2c_pow.value
i2c_pow.switch_to_output(not default_state)
# Block 2: sleep before i2c initialization
time.sleep(2)
i2c = I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA, frequency=125000)
# Block 3: sleep between i2c initialization and sensor setup
time.sleep(2)
am = adafruit_am2320.AM2320(i2c)
# Block 4: sleep before sensor read
time.sleep(2)

delay = 0.3
while True:
    print("Temperature: ", am.temperature)
    time.sleep(delay)
    print("Humidity: ", am.relative_humidity)
    time.sleep(delay)
    led.value = not led.value
```

1. Trial: disable block 4 --> still works
2. Trial: disable blocks 3, 4 --> still works
3. Trial: disable blocks 2, 3, 4 --> fails
4. Trial: disable blocks 1, 3, 4 --> still works
5. Trial: disable blocks 1, 3, 4 and insert a i2c power-cycle between the 2s sleep and the i2c initialization --> fails
6. Trial: take trial 5 and move the 2s sleep between i2c power-cycle and i2c initialization --> works

It turns out the following code works in both cases:

```python
import time
import board
from busio import I2C
import adafruit_am2320
import digitalio

led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.LED)
led.switch_to_output(True)

time.sleep(2)
i2c = I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA, frequency=125000)
am = adafruit_am2320.AM2320(i2c)

delay = 0.3
while True:
    print("Temperature: ", am.temperature)
    time.sleep(delay)
    print("Humidity: ", am.relative_humidity)
    time.sleep(delay)
    led.value = not led.value
```

# Open TODOs

- [ ] Measure current -- toggle lines to drive eInk low
- [ ] Profile rest of the application and reduce sleep times
- [ ] Buy SD card for logging of values
